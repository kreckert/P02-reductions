./kColSolve

based on Savile Row by Peter Nightingale (see subdirectory)

This directory contains MAC and LINUX versions of a k colouring solver. 
No Windows version is available but it should work in the Ubuntu subsystem (untested).

===========

NOTE ON FORMAT

The DIMACS COL format does not include a way to specify the number of colours required.  
To workaround this, I have added to the format 

After the "p edge" line and before the first line containing an edge, there should be:
     a line starting "colours" followed by a space and then an integer 
     where "colours" must be the first 7 characters of the line

E.g. the example uncolourable file contains the following two consecutive lines

p edge 11 20
colours 3

Note that because this line starts with a c it will be regarded as a comment by other colouring 
programs which use the DIMACS format 
===========


usage example: 

./kColSolve  < colourable.col

this will print to stdout a colouring if any is found, plus some search statistics.

Both the preprocessor and the solver (Savile Row and Minion) are limited to 60s each.

Note that the linux/mac version of savile row must be kept in the same directory as kColSolve.
